## Meeting Minutes (What Happened):

- We started with trying to come up with overall ideas, nothing in depth but we came up with ideas such as better quizlet, fashion, cards, workout, food, journals etc.
- We then asked chat gpt to provide us with some possible ideas that take advantage of using cards.
- This includes games that use shuffling, flipping, creating etc
- Afterwards we eliminated all our ideas until there were 4, that being: workout card, journal memory card, recipe card, and motivation card. 
- We all worked together to try to come up with as many ideas for each post-it as possible. 
- Afterwards, we voted by majority on eliminating the ideas that we didn’t want. 
- We ended with the idea of solving the problem of boring and inconsistent workouts since people struggle with knowing what worksout they want to do and keeping consistency. 
- We then created more ideas for workout cards, including the tree that we’ve included in our miro. 
- We added a theme, and some other ideas and we finished our brainstorming. 
- We then planned out our future tasks that we will do for the project pitch.
- Jeremy shared the presentation slides with everyone and assigned tasks
- Tomorrow we will individually work on our portion of the slides and get it done by tomorrow evening.

## Potential Ideas (select one out of list):

**Flashcards (Quizlet-esque)**

- Spaced out repetition type of cards
- Learning curve
- Have reinforced learning through spacing out new information learning throughout a span of time and repeated learning
- Could also be calendar-based and contain to-do-list in the form of cards
  
**Task management cards**
**Tarot Cards**

**Recipe Cards**

- Contain ingredients and step by step instructions

**Movie Cards**

**Daily affirmations**

- Shuffling to receive quotes or motivational things based on a choice made by the user

**Budget tracker with cards to visualize**

**Photo memory cards**

- Cards associated with photos and words associated with the memory
- Arranged in a timeline format

## *Workout Cards* (chosen idea)

- Shuffle ability to randomize a workout according to a specific muscle group
- If time permits, keep track of users “best” whenever they do an exercise
- Mark workout cards according to muscle group being hit (color code)
- Collection/sets of cards
- EX: “Push” Set -> {Card 1: bench press -> Card 2: incline bench press -> Card 3: Dips}
- Recommendation of weights based on user weight
- Pre-set “workout plans” (set of cards) and customizable sets of cards

## User Needs:

- A way to build more fun, exciting workouts
- Lessen the cognitive burden of formulating an extensive workout
